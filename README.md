LOCAL WEATHER APP 

This local weather app uses the OpenWeather API to pull local weather based on a user's geolocation. 

Current functions:

Unit Toggling - The user can choose between metric(C) and imperial(F) temperature units by toggling a button.

Weather Based Background - The image background changes depending on the weather and time (Day/Night) for most weather options.
